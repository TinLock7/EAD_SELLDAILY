# EAD_SELLDAILY
PROJECT IDEA:
Our project aims to solve the problems faced by start-up companies who fail to sell their manufactured products on popular e-commerce website due to the strong competition they face by the popular brands on this site.

We provide a platform to these start-ups by acting as a bridge between them and e-commerce website. We take in their manufactured products and sell them on our website providing them a larger reach.

PROJECT INSIGHTS:
Weâ€™ve implemented the project based on MERN stack. This project has already been implemented on Django as part of our SOAD Course.
